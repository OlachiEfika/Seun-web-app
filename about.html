            <div class="bio"><p><strong>Navigating life is hardly linear; it sometimes comes with many twists and turns that leave us feeling anxious, stuck, depressed and/or 
            overwhelmed. 
            In these moments, we feel confused and demotivated, alone with our thoughts, feelings and emotions. Alone, you may find it more difficult 
            to process these situations fully. 
            I am here to create a warm, safe, compassionate and non-judgemental space to help you to unburden your thoughts, feelings and emotions. 
            I have lived on three continents – Africa, Europe and North America- and I appreciate our unique cultures and individual experiences.
            I have experienced many life stressors that immigrants and multicultural groups face, such as acculturation, discrimination, 
            stigmatization and racism. These experiences have given me a deeper understanding of the intersectional barriers and mental health 
            challenges people from different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds go through. My priority is to build a trusting relationship with you and empower you with the tools and strategies you need to bring positive change. 
            My therapeutic approach is integrative as I draw from solutions and emotionally therapeutic frameworks, leveraging clients’ diverse 
            experiences and individuality, mutual respect, and cultural sensitivity.
