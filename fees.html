        <h1>Fees</h1>
            <p>Fees for Psychotherapy are based on guidelines for service in Toronto and depending on education level and experience of the therapist.  The clinic lead is a a Registered Psychotherapist with the College of Psychotherapy of Ontario with 5 years of additional training at the doctoral level and specific training in supervision and teaching of Masters' level therapists.  The other team members are seasoned professionals with significant training but less years in the practice of therapy, and are able to offer lower rates. Clients are asked to verify with their own insurance plans to see if the services of a Registered Psychotherapist are covered prior to making an appointment.  
            Every plan is different and clients can not be reimbursed for fees paid due to insurance not acceptance of receipts.
